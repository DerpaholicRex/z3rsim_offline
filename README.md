# Z3R Simulator Offline

This package contains an offline version of the Z3R Simulator, a tool for simulating and tracking progress in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Randomizer (Z3R) seeds.

This version loads the simulation from spoiler logs generated by the a link to the past randomizer website https://alttpr.com/en/randomizer

On the page you can now load a spoiler log with the load spoiler log button in the navbar.

If any problems arise, ensure the settings on the landing page match the settings used to generate the log (log should override, but i've not tested that. this project is VERY WIP)

How to Run
To use this offline simulator, you need to serve the contents of this folder using an HTTP server. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.


## Method 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)
This is the simplest method and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing this README file.

Run the following command:

Bash

python -m http.server 8000
On some systems, you may need to use python3 instead of python:

Bash

python3 -m http.server 8000
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

### üêç Installing Python
#### Windows
The easiest way to install Python on Windows is to download the official installer from the Python website. üíª

Go to the official Python downloads page for Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Download the latest stable release executable installer. Important: Choose the 64-bit installer if your system supports it.

Run the downloaded installer.

On the first screen, make sure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now". This will allow you to run Python from any command prompt.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

To verify the installation, open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type python --version or py --version. You should see the version number printed.

#### macOS
macOS comes with a pre-installed version of Python 2, but it's deprecated. It's best to install a modern version of Python 3. The recommended method is using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. üç∫

If you don't have Homebrew installed, open a terminal and run the following command:

Bash

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

Once Homebrew is installed, install Python by running this command in your terminal:

Bash

brew install python
Homebrew will automatically handle the installation and link the python3 command.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and type python3 --version. You should see the Python 3 version number.

#### Linux
Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. However, you might need to install Python 3 specifically, or a newer version than what's available. üêß

Debian/Ubuntu
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip  # pip is the package installer for Python, often useful
Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
Bash

sudo dnf install python3
Arch Linux
Bash

sudo pacman -S python
After installation, you can verify it by running python3 --version in your terminal. On most Linux systems, the Python 3 executable is aliased as python3.

## Method 2: Node.js HTTP Server
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the http-server package:

Install http-server globally (if not already installed):

Bash

npm install -g http-server
Navigate to the directory containing this README file.

Run:

Bash

http-server -p 8000
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

# Method 3: PHP Built-in Server
If you have PHP installed:

Navigate to the directory containing this README file.

Run:

Bash

php -S localhost:8000
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

## Method 4: Other Options
Apache/Nginx: Configure a virtual host pointing to this directory.

Live Server (VS Code Extension): Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

SimpleHTTPServer (Python 2): If you have Python 2, use python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000.

# Included Scripts
This package includes convenience scripts to start the Python HTTP server:

runSite.bat: For Windows systems

runSite.sh: For Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)

Simply double-click the appropriate script for your operating system, or run it from the command line.

# Features
Offline functionality - no internet connection required

Interactive map and item tracking

Spoiler log integration

Dungeon progress tracking

Seed metadata generation

# Requirements
A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)

An HTTP server (see methods above)

# Troubleshooting
If port 8000 is already in use, you can use a different port (e.g., python -m http.server 8080) and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Ensure you're running the server from the correct directory (the one containing index.html).

If you encounter CORS issues with certain browsers, try a different browser or disable security features temporarily.

# Contributing
This is an offline clone of the raw html from https://z3rsim.com/ (not even the source package). For issues or contributions related to the Z3R Simulator, please refer to the original project. 

However, until the Kyong returns, feel free to make contributions here.

If @Kyong wants me to take this down at any point, please ask and i'll do so gladly, until that point i'll provide it to anyone in the community who is interested
(alternatively if you want to share the source code, i'd love that over what i had to do here)
